This project is a very serious project about detecting cosmic rays coming from
outer space !

Usage:
* make: Build the program and place the binary `cosmic_ray_detector' inside the
  root of the repo.

* make check: Launch the testsuite.

* make clean: Clean the repo.

Information:
The program uses a very complicated algorithm to see if at least a single bit
from a simple variable is flipped.
